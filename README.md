The program implements the QuickHull algorithm to compute the convex hull of a 3D point set and generate a convex triangular mesh. It includes various data types and subroutines responsible for handling points, faces, and their relationships, performing geometric calculations such as normal vector computation and point-to-plane distance calculation. The code is optimized for parallel execution using OpenMP to enhance computational efficiency. Users can obtain the convex hull mesh of the input point set by calling the QuickHull() function.
